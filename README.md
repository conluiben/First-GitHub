# First-GitHub
My first GitHub

Hello world!
*Ignore this first hehe*

This GitHub page is to test all possible features. :)

05-16-2020: I revisit GitHub and test more features.
Funny, I didn't need a pull request anymore?
Now, I'm editing this with a new branch called first_branch
NEW DAY: I am still on first_branch, just added another line
Another one on first_branch, maybe the last, or is it?.
